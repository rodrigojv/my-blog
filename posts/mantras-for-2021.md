If anything has taught me in 2020 with COVID is that anything could change at any time, no matter how solid our plans are, a pandemic hits and everything goes through the window, and what's left? For me is to adapt and not to cling.

Not to cling to outcomes.

Not to cling to a job title.

Not to cling to material possesions.

Not to cling to a specific version of yourself or your life. Including a version or your body and your mental state.

Everything is always changing.

So the mantra for this year is not to cling and be willing to adapt when a change comes your way.

Like Bruce Lee says

> Be like water; water has form and yet it has no form. It is the sofest element on earth, yet it penetrates the hardest rock. It has no shape of its own, yet it can take any shape in which it is placed

It is also something that I have learned in life and reflect now as I am about to turn 38, that everything always come and go, friendships, places, even your own body changes, your mind is not the same, your tastes, inclinations and pretty much everything is in constant flux.

So what remains is to be present with this single moment, today, right here and right now, one step after the other, because tomorrow is unknown and all I have is this moment.
