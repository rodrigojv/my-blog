Halfway through 2020 I made the decision of staying out from social media. I've long before deleted my Facebook account but was still spending a lot of time on twitter and I started to feel the same mind-agitation that I had before when browsing Facebook.

So I stopped login-in on Twitter, never had the app on my phone anyways. And man oh man, it feels great! No more other people's thoughts and ideas on my brain, it feels so much spacious. Like Daniel LaRusso I have recovered some balance.

This is not an article to encourage you to do the same, I'm just writing about what is has helped me personally.

Social media and the internet in general is going to a really turbulent phase in my opinion, we shall see what the future holds. I really miss the days where you proactivily use the internet to find what you needed, nothing was there in your face to overwhelm your state of mind.

Going forward I'm planning to use Twitter to post links to my writings and promote things I consider are worth a retweet or an interaction.
