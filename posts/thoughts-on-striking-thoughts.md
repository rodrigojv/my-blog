I always thought of Bruce Lee as one of the most influential figures in movies and martial arts but I have never thought of him as I writer, let alone a great philosopher. I have many times come across with his famous ["Be like water, my friend"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ) video but I thought that was part of some kind of gimmick he had.

Turns out it wasn't and he actually studied philosophy at the University of Washington and spent a lot of time writing and thinking about that subject. This book is a collection of his writings, and it really suprised my on how good and thought provoking of a reading it is.

Bruce Lee's most common educational and literary form was the aphorism, and this book follows that style. An aphorism is a brief saying or phrase that expresses an opinion or makes a statement of wisdom and the intent of Bruce with the use of aphorism is

> to arouse a heart-felt "call to arms" and not intellectual abrstraction, however valid such abstraction may prove to be.

After reading a statement that Lee writes

> ...the reader is now compelled to think for himself about the issue, which leads the individual to produce his own answer. Lee always challenge his students (both in classroom an thorugh writings) no to agree or disagree, but to _grow_.

I really enjoyed this book, I read it from start to finish but I think that this is a better book to read when you need inspiration about a subject or early in the morning opening a random page and reading a couple of sentences to give a good start to your day.

Lee writes about many subjects like spirituality, meditation and teaching. Here are some of my favorite aphorism from the book.

About teaching

> **A teacher is a pointer of the truth, not a giver of truth.** A teacher, a good teacher that is, functions as a pointer of truth, but not a giver of truth. He employs a minimum of form to lead his student to the formless. Furthermore, he points out the importance of being able to enter a mold without being imprisoned by it, or to follow the principles without being bound by them.

> **Put my words to the test.** Remember, I am no teacher; I can merely be a signpost for a traveler who is lost. It is up to you to decide on the direction. All I can offer is an experience but never a conclusion, so even what I have said needs to be thoroughly examined by you.

And finally this one about adaptability which besides being great quote, it summarizes Bruce Lee's philosohpy about life and also emcompases many ideas that he mentions throughout the book.

> **Adapt like water.** Be like water; water has form and yet it has no form. It is the sofest element on earth, yet it penetrates the hardest rock. It has no shape of its own, yet it can take any shape in which it is placed. In a cup, it becomes the shape of the cup. In a vase, it takes the shape of the vase and curls about the stems of flowers. Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Please observe the adaptability of water. If you squeeze it fast, the water will flow out quickly. If you squeeze it slowly, it will come out slowly. Water may seem to move in contradiction, even uphill, but it chooses any way open to it so that it may reach the sea. it may flow swiftly or it may flow slowly, but its purpose is inexorable, its destiny sure.

In conclusion, always observe the water my friend.
